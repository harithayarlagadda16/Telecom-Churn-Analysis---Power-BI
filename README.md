# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-BI
 Dashboard on Telecom Churn Analysis with Insights created in Power BI.

# Business case: 

Telecom Churn Analysis Telecom Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for telecom companies because it is expensive to acquire a new customer and companies want to retain their existing customers. Most telecom companies suffer from voluntary churn.Customer churn is when a companyâ€™s customers stop doing business with that company.  New business involves working leads through a sales funnel, using marketing and sales budgets to gain additional customers.Customer retention can be achieved with good customer service and products. But the most effective way for a company to prevent attrition of customers is to truly know them. The vast volumes of data collected about customers can be used to build churn prediction models. Knowing who is most likely to defect means that a company can prioritise and focus marketing efforts on that subset of their customer base.


# Problem Statement and recommended analysis:

Churn data for a Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to **7,043** customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status. The below noted Analysis was requested from the Data.

2. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?
3. What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
4. Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?

After the hands on data it was taken to EXCEL for the basic cleaning and preparation process like removing duplicates, errors and blanks.Then it was connected to Power BI for further analysis and designing the Dashboard. Various visualisation tools were used to make the Analysis look simple yet effective for the client to understand.
